# Code Invaders 👾

Arcade‑style React/TypeScript game that helps you learn programming keywords by typing them as they fall.

## 🎮 Gameplay
- Keywords from languages like **C++**, **Java**, **C#**, **Python**, and **JavaScript** descend from the top of the screen.
- Type the keyword correctly before it reaches the bottom to score points.
- Sound effects and a live score counter keep the action fast and fun.
- Designed to be both a **typing challenge** and a **learning tool**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **React + TypeScript** (SPA with Vite or CRA)
- **HTML5 Canvas** for rendering
- **CSS/Audio** for retro arcade feel
